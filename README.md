## Site 1
https://www.q30design.com/
- Found it researching for a different project. It was the web page for a design firm that one, something.
- Seems current, very simple layout. Main page is series of pictures with a breif of who they are, and what they do. Navigation bar at the very top of the page. Everything just shrinks in smaller windows.
- Navigation is familiar and simple. Bar across the top of the screen, no dropdown(hamburger) menu. Tabs to 5 different areas of the site.
- The tabs on the navigation bar are interactive. The main page has, something like section tags that drops you down to the next piece of info on that page.
- it's useful, sure. Dont think its all to flashy but the firm seems like they'd rather get to the point of what they do, so it works. Nah very plain and simple I guess.
- make it slightly more uniform?

## Site 2
https://bitmark.com/
- Research for the same project as site 1. Was looking into new tech to look out for in the design world.
- Its quite modern looking. The main page is simple. Navigation bar at the top again, but comes with more features and shrinks into a dropdown menu. Which is nice. Has a statement of what the do, says what it needs to without taking up too much space. Types nice. each seperate page is uniform with the others only displaying the bare information.
- Navigation is verry simple. Bar at the top each tab has its own drop down with more specific options. The menu itself will colapse into a dropdown menu in smaller window sizes.
- The dropdown menu, the "more" buttons, and some words that are differently colored are clickable.
-its all 3.
- Don't really get it enough to want to change anthing.

## Site 3
https://dingwellfh.ca/
- Research for my corporate design class, was looking up company logos.
- A lot like the last two site, the look of this one follows some similar trends. Large imgae, company/brand/statement in the middle, navigation top right and folds to a drop down in small windows, and everything is you need is on one page.
- You click on a link its sends you down the page. there is a tab that basically reloads the screen with the obituaries on top of everything else that would be on the main page.
- The whole thing seems interactive. Each section has something you can click on that leads you to the bottom of the main page.
- Sure its useful, and about as interesting as a funeral home webpage can get.

## Site 4
https://greatjonesgoods.com/
- Digging through are.na for this project found this site for cookware.
- Different from the last site where the navigation isn't at the top right away, but seperated like folder tabs. It has a modern feel with a rustic look, very warm and almost retro feeling the way they are stacked. Has some floating illustrations of fruits and vegetables, very nice.
- Navigations good. Main page can be navigated through the tabs, that either switch tabs or take you to other pages. Simple to use.
- The tabs navigate, some images take you to the product, the logo takes you to the home page.
- Sites pretty nice for cookware. Thing i like most about this place is that you can choose colors for your pots, and one of the colors is "Mustard" yellow.
- It's a cookware site, so i guess more cookware.

## Site 5
http://wrongwrong.net/
- are.na. It had a nice thumbnail.
- Oh it looks. Looks a bit artsy. Is a webzine, just looks cool.
- series of photos and articles that take you to pages or open pop-up windows. logo takes you home. Its uncommon to me, but simple to use.
- The whole thing?
- At first completely thrown off, but its cool makes you want to explore see what it has to offer. Sure its interestingly useful?
- Nothing, its doing it's own thing.
